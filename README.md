#shifty
###A simple to use shift register library for Arduino
##Usage:
###This library uses a custom Pin class for reasons that were more clear to me a week ago
###To use the shift register, you must first create pins for at least the clock (CLK) and data (DS) connections
###on the 74hc595 shift register. You can also add asynchronous reset, output latch, and output enable pins. 
###An example is given in Shift595_test.h
